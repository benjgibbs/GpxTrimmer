The fantastic GpedToGpx script creates a lot of points.  My poor old garmin cannot handle that many points so this script parses the points and incrementally removes them.

This is a work in progress.

To Do:

* Fix the turn calculation - still somehting strange going on here
* don't hardcode the input
* Work out how to link it to the script

Done:
* Output the resut into xml
