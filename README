The fantastic GpedToGpx script creates a lot of points.  My poor old garmin cannot handle that many points so this script parses the points and incrementally removes them.

This is a work in progress.

To Do:

1. Fix the turn calculation
2. don't hardcode the input
3. Output the resut into xml
4. Work out how to link it to the script
